    <h2>Description</h2>
    </p><p> 
    The experiments I've done have been interesting.  Flatter
    than I had hoped, but with a soft interior and a very thin 
    crunchy outside.  Pretty close to the cake donuts I'd hoped
    for.
    </p><p> 
    The next batch, I'll try for 1/2 thickness, then cut.
    I'm thinking of something like dowels or such.
    </p><p> 
    Third batch I made a full batch, using the liquid
    from some cans of sweet potato instead of milk.
</p><p> 
    I had to add more liquid as 1 cup left the dough
    very stiff.  I got it to a very soft, slightly
    sticky stage.  Rolled to 1/2 inch thick and gently
    cut the donuts.  I baked them on oiled parchment and
    oiled the donuts before cooking.
</p><p> 
    This variation is much closer to the deep-fry 
    variety.  Texture is much like a cake donut.
    The crumb looks like I remember home fried
    donuts looked when I'd break one open.

    <h2>Notes</h2>


    <p>
        This recipe makes a very soft and tender dough that you can roll out 
        to thickness, then cut out the donuts and holes.  These were meant
        to float in the hot fat while they fried, but since we have to deal
        with gravity in the air fryer, you should be able to flour the 
        bottoms and slip them into the basket, right?
    </p><p>

        The dough is soft enough to ooze slightly through the holes
        in the basket and form millions of little brown crusty nuggets
        that you have to remove before the experimental donuts can be
        released from the mesh.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently experimenting with this recipe in my Air-fry 
        tabletop oven.  It's a lot smaller than our currently nonfunctional
        antique gas oven. It's fine for 2 person portions, so I'm 
        pleased with it so far.
    </p><p>
        My starting recipe for these donuts was taken from an unknown
        cookbook, guessing from illustration style, from 1930 - 1950.
        My guess would be late 30's, just before WWII.
