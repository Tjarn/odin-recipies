    <h1>Recipes</h1>
    <p>
        This recipe collection is for recipes that I have found interesting enough
        to add to it.  I'm mostly interested in recipes that are for one or two people and 
        that are easily made in or adapted to air frying or baking in my 
        air-fryer/convection oven.  I don't need to risk hot fat burns from deep 
        frying.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll try to keep notes on the recipes that I make and I'll try to update recipes
        as I go.  See the notes on the recipes to see what I've rememered to, or 
        found time to update.

    </p>
    <p>
        This is definitely a work in progress.  I'm keeping it under a revision
        control system (git on GitHub) so if I mess up anything, I'll try to revert
        and get back what works. Or at least have a fighting chance to do so.
    </p>
    <p>How to reach me:
        reverse the name and domain and e-mail me. 
            wavecable.com@morganh
        which should mess up dumb robots and let smart ones and people through. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If a robot is smart enough to email, I'll converse, but won't buy anything.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        With that, Here's what I have so far.  I'll probably have to add categories
        later, but this is early days.

<h2>Adding Recipes</h2>    
    
    This section is for my future self, so I don't have to refigure out what hooks to what.
    Here's the steps I use, more or less as I learn more.

    <ol class="Instructions">

        <li>
    
    <h3>Copy the recipe template file to the recipes directory.</h3>

    <p>
        The recipe template file is in the file 
        Recipes/recipes/resources/templates/recipe.template.html
        The file 'index.html' is the root file of this document.  The recipe file itself
        is in the Recipes/recipe directory.
    </p>
        </li>
        <li>

    <h3>Give the File a Descriptive Name</h3>
    <p>
        Name your new file whatever name you want to access it from the main document.
        I prefer a descriptive name, because I browse directories and like to know what
        I'm looking at.  I can imagine a tool, however, that would let me seek what kind
        of file is is as well as a way to quick preview the front, rear, and spots in between.
    </p>
    </li>

    

    <h3>Off-Topic Digression</h3>
    <p>
        OK, grasshopper mind in action.  I think I'll put this off to one side, here.       
    </p>
<h4>project idea</h4>
<p class="Project Idea"></p>
grasshopper mind again -- my idea is to document my ideas as I work, tagging them with the 
class 'Project Idea'  That would give me something to look for and  might keep them
from printing, or setting them off to not interfere with the function of the document.
<p class="Project Idea">
The idea that started this:  I can imagine a tool, however, that would let me seek what kind
of file is is as well as a way to quick preview the front, rear, and spots in between.
--- 
A file explorer that is like a shell window (cli for young'ns) with buttons
to popup Unix file type, text display of head, tail, and random within body, precise within body.
cli or gooey like cli. -- ok, written down, let me get back to this later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your file  is sensibly named?
    </p>
    <li>
   <h3>Test Template File in Browser</h3>
   <p>
    The template file has the html boilerplate it needs, and run from the Recipes/recipes directory has the links 
    for the home page installed.  
   </p>     
   <p>
    You should observe that the page stying is correct on the template file.  Don't test the buttons to the index
    until you're ready to edit the Recipes/index.html file, as there are no links back until you create them.
   </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Link From Index to File </h3>
    <p>

        The home index file is in the directory above this so links from here will go to "../index.html" and links
        from that directory will go to "./recipes/my_sensible_file_name" to your sensibly named file in the 
        Recipies index.html directory.
    </p> 
</li>
<li>
    <h3>
        Create Link from Home index.html
    </h3>
    Make a link <div style ="font-weight: bolder;">from</div> the home index file 
    <div style ="font-weight: bolder;">to</div> your sensibly-named file in the recipes
    directory.
</li>
</ol>
    That should be enough.
    <h3>
        
    </h3>
