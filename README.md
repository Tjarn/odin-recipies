# odin-recipies

I created this repo as part of the odin project lesson 'recipies'
in the course called 'foundations'.

I just 'celebrated' my 80th birthday and ran across this site.  I've
been a proponent of open source since the early 1990's and celebrated
when Linux jumped from version 0.92 to 1.0.0.  

I've bumbled along with numerous tutorials and a quick scan of the courses
told me two things.

1. It looks like things are done right and learners can actually learn.

2. I can afford it.  At my age on a fixed income things can get tight.

But on the internet the effect of age are mitigated.  

Since I don't have to travel to learn, and there's a possibility that
someone might want to pay me for doing something that's fun and amusing,
well then I ought to give it a try.

I'm about halfway through the 'Foundations' course and I'm enjoying it
a lot.  Lots of concepts that I used to play with are rustling around and
demanding to be let out to play.  I'm enjoying it enough that I'll probably
put myself through the full stack Javascript program.

Oh, If you find something useful here, you're welcome to it under GPL3.
