I've learned a lot on this project. I could probably take it apart and put
it back together better, but this is done, and OK.

Now to add a recipe and link it in.

I've got a skeleton of a little website here, but it might make a useful
little tool on a pad in the kitchen.  So that's what I'll aim this for
when the class is finished.

The jounal-type stuff I had here is in DOC/Journal.md

This is a work in progress. It's raw HTML and I'm just starting the
CSS section.
